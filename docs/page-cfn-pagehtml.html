    <div class="step" data-step="1"><h3>Global CO<sub>2</sub> emision from Fossil Fuels</h3><hr class="cfn-step-header-hr" style="border-color: #3E3E3E;">
    <p>Global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuels totalled 37.5 Gt (Gigatonnes) in 2023. These emissions come from the combustion of <span class='coal'>coal</span>, <span class='oil'>oil</span>, <span class='gas'>gas</span> and <span class='ff-other'>other</span> processes like cement production.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="2"><p>That is up 1% from compared to 2022, when emissions totalled 37.1 Gt.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="3"><p>Emissions from 2023 are also the highest historically.</p>
    <p>However, over the last decade, the annual growth rate of emissions has significantly slowed compared to the period spanning from 1950 to 2012. We hopefully move beyond peak emissions in the next few years.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="4"><p>Next, let's dive into national and regional emissions.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="5"><h3>European Union (EU27)</h3><hr class="cfn-step-header-hr" style="border-color: #377EB8;">
      <p>The combined fossil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the current <span class='underlineRegion underlineEU27'>27 EU nations</span> peaked around 1980 after a long period of fast increase every year.</p>
    <p>Since 2006 there is steady decline of fossil CO<sub>2</sub> emission. </p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="6"><p><b>Territorial and consumption emissions</b></p>
    <p>The line shows CO<sub>2</sub> emitted inside the territory of the 27 EU nations. They also import a lot of goods and the production emissions of those goods are counted to the territory of the producing country. When we put those emissions on the EU's account we get the so called consumption emissions. The shaded area shows the increase (it is only available from 1990 till 2021). </p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="7"><p>The EU's consumption emissions are quite a bit higher than the terrotorial emissions. However, it is not the case the EU nations are reducing emissions by 'off-setting' their emissions abroad. Both the territorial and consumption emissions are reducing similarly since 2006.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="8"><h3>USA</h3><hr class="cfn-step-header-hr" style="border-color: #B69121;">
      <p>In the <span class='underlineRegion underlineUSA'>USA</span> emissions have peaked two decades ago and they are also steadily declining since 2006.</p>
      <p>When taking into account the consumption emissions of the USA they are also still decreasing.</p>
    <p>The USA and EU27 have shown that economic growth is possible with reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="9"><h3>India</h3><hr class="cfn-step-header-hr" style="border-color: #138808;">
      <p>In the last 30 years <span class='underlineRegion underlineIndia'>India</span> is developing quickly. This rapid development is paired with increasing fossil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
    <p>Due to exports, India's consumption emissions are lower than the emissions within their borders, although only slightly.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="10"><h3>China</h3><hr class="cfn-step-header-hr" style="border-color: #E41A1C;">
      <p>At the turn of the century, China experienced unprecedented increases in fossil fuel consumption, tripling its coal consumption within a decade.</p>
    <p>China does produce an incredible amount of products for the world. In the last 20 years from 7% up to 20% of yearly emissions were for exported goods.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="11"><h3>Bunker fuels</h3><hr class="cfn-step-header-hr" style="border-color: #0033CC;">
      <p>Bunker fuels emissions are <span class='underlineRegion underlineBunker'>international aviation and shipping</span> emissions. They are not easily attributed to specific nations.</p>
    <p>They dropped a lot during the covid pandemic, but they are on the rise again.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="12"><h3>Rest of the World</h3><hr class="cfn-step-header-hr" style="border-color: #3E3E3E;">
      <p>The emissions from <span class='underlineRegion underlineROW'>all other countries combined</span> have possibly peaked and hopefully started a long term decline.</p>
    <p>This group comprises numerous developed and developing nations, in the next section some of these will be highlighted.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="13"><h3>Per Capita Emissions</h3><hr class="cfn-step-header-hr" style="border-color: #000000;">
      <p><span class='underlineRegion underlineChina'>China</span> currently is the largest emitter, however it also has a very large population. When focusing on per-capita emissions, the USA historically and presently stands out.</p>
    <p>The black line (Rest of the World) represents many nations, some with low, but also some with very high per-capita emissions. Let's highlight some of these next.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="14"><h3>Canada</h3><hr class="cfn-step-header-hr" style="border-color: #FF0000;">
    <p><span class='underlineRegion underlineCanada'>Canada's</span> historic per capita emissions have great resemblence to those of the USA. It is lower maninly due the fact that Canada has had relatively lower coal usage and a significant amount of hydro power.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="15"><h3>Australia</h3><hr class="cfn-step-header-hr" style="border-color: #00008B;">
      <p>Australia also has very high per-capita emissions, but it's also a great example of how swiftly per-capita emissions can go from a strong increase to a strong decrease within just a few years.</p>
    <p>A significant part of their emissions are for export, but even with that taken into account they are large per capita emitters.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="16"><h3>Saudi-Arabia</h3><hr class="cfn-step-header-hr" style="border-color: #006C35;">
    <p>Like many other Middle Eastern countries that are rich in fossil fuels, Saudi-Arabia rapidly started extracting and burning fossil fuels since the middle of the last century.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="17"><h3>United Arab Emirates</h3><hr class="cfn-step-header-hr" style="border-color: #00732F;">
      <p>When we highlight the historic per capita emission of the <span class='underlineRegion underlineUAE'>United Arab Emirates</span> we have to adjust the range. United Arab Emirates experienced a surge in per capita emissions following the abundant availability of fossil fuels in 1969. Back in those days it's population was only around 250k and has increased to over 9 million inhabitants currently.</p>
    <p>Next, let's look into the per capita emissions of some other large economic powers.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="18"><h3>United Kingdom</h3><hr class="cfn-step-header-hr" style="border-color: #00247D;">
      <p>The Industrial Revolution started in the <span class='underlineRegion underlineUK'>UK</span>. The UK has a long history with coal, which by now have been almost completely phased out. The current per capita emissions are roughly equal to those of 1850, but keep in mind that actual emissions are roughly 2.5 times as high due to the population increase.</p>
    <p>The UK has significantly higher consumption emissions, despite that the downward trend looks very promising.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="19"><h3>Russia</h3><hr class="cfn-step-header-hr" style="border-color: #0033A0;">
      <p>The historic emissions of Russia are unlike any other. The dissolution of the Soviet Union caused an incredible drop in per capita emissions.</p>
      <p>The trade-adjusted consumption emissions for Russia are significantly lower, however per capita emissions are still relatively high.</p>
    <p>Russia uses mostly natural gas, which has lower emissions than coal and oil, however the amount of energy used per capita is really high in Russia causing high emissions despite the natural gas.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="20"><h3>Japan</h3><hr class="cfn-step-header-hr" style="border-color: #BC002D;">
      <p><span class='underlineRegion underlineJapan'>Japan's</span> oil consumption grew incredibly fast during the 1960s. That growth stopped abruptly during the first oil crisis as Japan tried to reduce its dependency on oil.</p>
    <p>Japan's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have clearly peaked and been steadily declining since 2013.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="21"><p>All the per-capita emissions we have seen so far are in stark contrast with the average per-capita emissions of the continents South America and Africa.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="22"><h3>South American continent</h3><hr class="cfn-step-header-hr" style="border-color: #FFD700;">
    <p>The average per capita emissions of South America are lower than the global average and they have been decreasing since 2014. Brazil, with half of the continent's population, generates a lot of its energ from hydro and bioenergy. </p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="23"><h3>African continent</h3><hr class="cfn-step-header-hr" style="border-color: #008000;">
    <p>The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita on the African continent are notably low and show no signs increase.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="24"><h3>End notes</h3><hr class="cfn-step-header-hr" style="border-color: #787878;">
    <p>Further sharp increases of national emissions, particularly in <span class='underlineRegion underlineChina'>China</span>, must be avoided. The Western nations, who have historically emitted so much, must support other nations to develop with reduced emissions.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="25"><p>The <span class='underlineRegion underlineGlobal'>global</span> average per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions already peaked in 2012. This is a first good sign that overall emissions can peak very soon too, after which we can globally start a rapid decline that some nations have already shown is possible.</p></div>
    <div class="step" data-step="26"><h3>Data sources</h3><hr class="cfn-step-header-hr" style="border-color: #787878;">
      <p>All emissions data from the 2023 Global Carbon Budget by the Global Carbon Project.</p>
    <p>Population data for per capita calculations is from Our World in Data.</p></div>
